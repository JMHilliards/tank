This is a simple tank game written in Python/PyGame.
See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgV-MCL1W5c for a short demo.

You control the green tank and fight against the computer (red tank).

By using the UP and DOWN keys you can control the angle of your cannon.
Press LEFT-CTRL or LEFT-ALT to change the power level of the shoot.
The SPACE key will launch the cannonball.
The LEFT and RIGHT keys help you to move your tank to the left and right.

Your energy is shown with the green gauge. The energy level of the
computer's tank is shown with red gauge. The aim is to decrease the
computer's energy level to zero and keep yours.

Avoid of falling too much since falling may decrease your energy level.
